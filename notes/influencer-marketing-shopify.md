## Finding Influencers
* **Message:** Hey, do you do paid promotions? I am not looking for link clicks just followers and awareness. Please let me know so we can arrange a promotion together!

## Use [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/) to Check Influencer Stats
* If you see a 40,000+ follower day...
* The influencer has 50,000 followers total...
* And everyday they get 5-6...
* YOU KNOW ITS FAKE.
* However, if the growth is stable on their account that is VERY good and shows they are real profiles.
* The other way to tell if they are real or not is looking at the comments. If they have 1 million followers and 2 comments.. we have a problem. If they have 1 million followers and 300 - 500 comments that is not the worst but the more the better!

## Contacting Influencers
* Direct message them on Instagram and get RIGHT to the point. I message 20-30 at a single given time. After I message them I write on their posts "check your DM's" so they know I messaged them in case it went to their other inbox.
* **Message:** We're looking to drive sales to our ecommerce store through a paid promotion.
* Craft your own messages and be very professional. Build rapport.

## Influencer types
* Type A = Celebrities such as: Kim K, Drake, LeBron James, etc.
  * **$250k+ for a shout out**
* Type B = These are micro celebrities such as Jen Selter, and other people with 1-3 million followers that are ONLY famous on Instagram (typically the best but somewhat expensive)
  * **$1k-$4k (IDEAL)**
  * These are the types you want to target because they have MILLIONS of loyal followers.
  * They are fairly cheaper.
  * Their audience will RAVE about what they are raving about.
  * You can get so much clout (how many people are talking about your brand) for your store. The best part is they have 1-3m followers on average and they will promote you for a few thousand.
  * **You can reuse their content in your marketing and target their audience on Instagram via the FaceBook power editor.**
* Type C = These are generic pages. Pages like 'I love basketball'
  * **$40-$100**
  * Mass pages are not celebrity based but they are just around a certain topic like "basketball" or "dogs".
  * These are the best for engagement and getting a TON of people to see your page and posts.
  * This has the LOWEST rate of conversion. They are more than likely NOT to purchase from you or they purchase at a VERY low rate.
  * However this DOES NOT mean they will NOT purchase from you!! Keep in mind this is GREAT to build an audience with that you can retarget with inside of Facebook.

## Retarget Instagram on FB
* **Increase Your ROI**
* You can take your instagram page and retarget everyone who engages with it on Facebook
* Once you build an audience of people who interacted with your page you will be able to create look alike audiences (LAA's)
* If one of your campaigns does really well you will be able to have TONS of engagers and build a massive retargeting audience that you can push offers to very often.
* **Make sure your IG account is a business profile because that will be the only way you can link it up with Facebook**

## How To Make Sales with Influencers
### 4 Simple Strategies
* **BOGO**
  * Buy one get one free is a great way to jump start your sales.
  * HOWEVER, you are going to train your Facebook pixel to find 'bottom of the barrel' people who are ONLY looking to get the free item or they are purchasing from you because they get something for free
  * This is GREAT to cook your pixel but PLEASE make sure you understand this can backfire greatly.
  * This can also be your entire business model so you minus well go all in if you are going to follow this model
* **60% off (link in description)**
  * Your influencer post can say how you are giving 60% off
  * The link is going to be in the description (must agree to do that with the influencer before hand)
  * 60% isn't what you should do however, OVERWHELM them with the percentage off where it makes it a no brainer
  * If you can give more with decent margins, good. If not give what you feel comfortable with
* **Use Coupon code XYZ**
  * Influencers can tell a user to go directly to your site and use coupone code XYZ for $X off or X% off.
  * This is going to be another powerful strategy if you GEAR the coupon towards the influencer.
  * IE: Dan50 for 50% off. Jon50 for 50%. If the influencers name is Dan or Jon use their name.
  * If you want to get CRAZY with it limit the coupon for XYZ uses. Limit it to 50 sales and once the sales are done collect emails and in the email sequence you can 're open' it. (SUPER SNEAK AND ADVANCED STRATEGY).
* **Affiliates**
  * Getting affiliates for your store is going to be one of the best ways for you to growth hack your entire store.
  * Affiliates for your products will do some INCREDIBLE revenue if you load up on affiliates.
  * However if you focus on affiliates this needs to be your business model. Meaning you need to rely and heavily recruit on affiliates to keep you afloat.
  * MANY up and coming stores do this. It's VERY powerful if you use this as a 'side income' rather then solely relying on it. HOWEVER, you can easily pivot once you hit a certain level of sales and want to expand.
* **Free + Shipping**
  * Works best for IG per Hayden Bowles
