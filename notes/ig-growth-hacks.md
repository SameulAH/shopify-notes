# Instagram Growth Hacking Tips
* Use as many **hashtags** as possible
  * [Hashtagify](http://hashtagify.me/hashtag/smm) helps you find the best hashtags along with their data
* Best times to post on Instagram are in the morning and evenings 11am - 1pm and 7pm - 9pm
* Browse sponsored post with keywords like `#ad` and `#sponsored` to find influencers in your niche
* Utilize influencers with smaller audience [10k]
* Share **video content** to skyrocket your Instagram marketing. Repost videos of other peoples content with credit
  * Use [Repost](http://repostapp.com/) to *repost* content from other users
  * **Always Always. Always. ALWAYS** credit the person you’re tagging. You didn’t take the picture or video. It’s not your content. When you credit the people you post, over time you’ll start building relationships with them. 
* Show off your customer photos in Instagram marketing. You can install [Snapppt](https://apps.shopify.com/instagram-shop-by-snapppt) on Shopify
* Remove business tags for negative customer photos – Insta Hack
* Maintain a consistent look throughout your IG brand
* Only post 2 - 3x a day 3 is considered high
* Save posts you love. Especially successful and poor ads to learn from
* You can post more than just product photos
  * Quotes/Inspiration
  * Repost content
  * Pop Culture References
  * Sales and Promotions
  * Contests and Giveaways
* Find out what post your competitors like
  * Follow them with your personal page and just review their likes
  * Customer photos (what products did they buy, what was the general tone of the post)
  * Influencer posts (how many followers do they have, do they add an affiliate link in their bio, what type of influencers are they working with)
  * What type of content do they like (is it only brand related – customer/influencer posts? Do they like posts within the niche? Do they like a lot of posts? What type of comments do they like?)
* Add Captions to Instagram
  * Ask a question that requires an answer. It doesn’t always have to be about the product. For example, if you post a picture of a watch you’re selling, you might ask ‘What time did you see this post at?’ Time is relevant to watches, it can help increase engagement in comments since everyone will have a different response and it’s pretty random capturing people’s attention.
  * Ask people to tag a friend. This one is my favorite. I’ll usually say something like ‘Tag a friend who’d love this’ and it usually gets really high engagement if the picture is captivating.
  * Tell people to check out the link in your bio. If you post a product picture, the emphasis should be on directing people to your website. A simple ‘Check out the link in the bio’ is sufficient.
  * Credit the image source. If you’re reposting someone’s content you should always credit them in the caption. It’s the proper Instagram etiquette for sharing someone’s content.
* What about hashtags?
  * I usually add all my hashtags in the first comment. By keeping the caption short and sweet, you avoid having your message cut off while also increasing your level of engagement. Hashtags still show up when they’re included in the first comment.
* Add Two-Factor Authentication to Prevent Instagram Hacking
* Talia Koren, Instagram Marketing Consultant, grew her Work Week Lunch account to over 70,000 followers. She recommends this Instagram hack, “One of the most effective things I did to grow was I started making shareable content in my niche. I paid close attention to the content that got reposted, and how I could make my own version of it. That meant I stopped using my iPhone and switched to a real camera. I started using Snapseed to edit my photos on my phone and strategically tagging people who would be interested in sharing my content. And it worked! Now my content gets shared 5-10 times a week on accounts of all sizes, some have over 700k followers.”
