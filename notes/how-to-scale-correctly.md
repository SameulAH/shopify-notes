# How To Scale Correctly 
**Tim Sharp -**
* Dont be tempted to ramp up 100x
* Increase budget by 1.5x
* Keep it for another 3 days
* Did you generate a profit or breakeven?
  * Yes ~ increase budget by another 1.5x
  * No ~ go back to previous budget

# Scale or Kill 
**Tim Sharp -**
* Run the ad(s) for 3 days
* Objective is to make a profit or breakeven
* Not all ads will generate sales, maybe 1:10
* Kill non-performing ads after 3 days **BE BRUTAL!**
* THE WINNING AD WILL GENERATE $$$


# Daily Budget 
**Dan Dasilva -**
* Ideally you want to start off with $20/day for 5 days
* HOWEVER you can do $8 for 7 days and get the same data (or close to it)
* $5 daily budgets is OKAY and they have their place however you want to focus on $8 or $20 to get preliminary data to your ads
* Monitoring your ads: you want to check on them AFTER 3 days to see if they are running and the spend is going. DO NOT TOUCH THEM. DO NOT DO ANYTHING. LET THEM RUN once you launch them!

# $5 A Day Method
**Sean Prentice -**
* Go to Facebook ads and create 3 different ad sets
* For example: Say you are selling a water bottle infuser. You might create campaigns for people interested in yoga, detox, and juicing
* Now your going to let each campaign start at $5 a day. Then run them up to $30 each
* If you dont get a sale within the $5-$30 you've spent on the interest for your ad, kill that campaign
