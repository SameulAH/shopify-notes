## Majority Of Your Sales
* 30%-40% of your store revenue will come from emails
* Once someone purchases you are going to want to send them anywhere from 14-30 days worth of emails PROMOTING other products in your store
* Since you already know they are PROVEN to buy you can offer them special deals, redeemable coupons, bundle offers, etc
* You can even promote up to 4-8 different products to 1 single person with EASE and the best part is, the sale will always keep coming
* Email every other day

## The Abandonment Funnel
* 1 hour: send an email like 'Hey you forgot...'
* 24 hours: 'Do you still want it?'
* 48 hours: send coupons/ have a funnel in place like tri-funnels
* If all else fails put them in the promotions email funnel
