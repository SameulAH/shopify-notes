# Perfect Funnel Flow

* Congruency is key (if you sell cat socks -> offer them something cat related)
* Price ideally 1.5-3x the front end price
* Don't go deeper than 3 products because your customers are going to get annoyed
* Ideally every product in your funnel should be a stand alone item inside of your store front as well
