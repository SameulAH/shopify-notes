### Step 1
* Go to Aliexpress and find a product with at least 500 orders
* Download the images

### Step 2
* Find someone on Fiverr to make you some nice images by adding text to them

### Step 3
* Set up a [Click Funnel](https://www.clickfunnels.com/) you will get a higher conversion rate than you would with your Shopify store

### Step 4
* Go to Facebook ads and create 3 different ad sets
* For example: Say you are selling a water bottle infuser. You might create campaigns for people interested in yoga, detox,  and juicing
* Now your going to let each campaign start at $5 a day. Then run them up to $30 each
* If you dont get a sale within the $5-$30 you've spent on the interest for your ad, kill that campaign
