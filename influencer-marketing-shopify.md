## Finding Influencers
* **Message:** Hey, do you do paid promotions? I am not looking for link clicks just followers and awareness. Please let me know so we can arrange a promotion together!

## Use [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/) to Check Influencer Stats
* If you see a 40,000+ follower day...
* The influencer has 50,000 followers total...
* And everyday they get 5-6...
* YOU KNOW ITS FAKE.
* However, if the growth is stable on their account that is VERY good and shows they are real profiles.
* The other way to tell if they are real or not is looking at the comments. If they have 1 million followers and 2 comments.. we have a problem. If they have 1 million followers and 300 - 500 comments that is not the worst but the more the better!

## Contacting Influencers
* Direct message them on Instagram and get RIGHT to the point. I message 20-30 at a single given time. After I message them I write on their posts "check your DM's" so they know I messaged them in case it went to their other inbox.
* **Message:** We're looking to drive sales to our ecommerce store through a paid promotion.
* Craft your own messages and be very professional. Build rapport.

## Influencer types
* Type A = Celebrities such as: Kim K, Drake, LeBron James, etc.
  * **$250k+ for a shout out**
* Type B = These are micro celebrities such as Jen Selter, and other people with 1-3 million followers that are ONLY famous on Instagram (typically the best but somewhat expensive)
  * **$1k-$4k (IDEAL)**
  * These are the types you want to target because they have MILLIONS of loyal followers.
  * They are fairly cheaper.
  * Their audience will RAVE about what they are raving about.
  * You can get so much clout (how many people are talking about your brand) for your store. The best part is they have 1-3m followers on average and they will promote you for a few thousand.
  * **You can reuse their content in your marketing and target their audience on Instagram via the FaceBook power editor.**
* Type C = These are generic pages. Pages like 'I love basketball'
  * **$40-$100**
  * Mass pages are not celebrity based but they are just around a certain topic like "basketball" or "dogs".
  * These are the best for engagement and getting a TON of people to see your page and posts.
  * This has the LOWEST rate of conversion. They are more than likely NOT to purchase from you or they purchase at a VERY low rate.
  * However this DOES NOT mean they will NOT purchase from you!! Keep in mind this is GREAT to build an audience with that you can retarget with inside of Facebook.

## Retarget Instagram on FB
* **Increase Your ROI**
* You can take your instagram page and retarget everyone who engages with it on Facebook
* Once you build an audience of people who interacted with your page you will be able to create look alike audiences (LAA's)
* If one of your campaigns does really well you will be able to have TONS of engagers and build a massive retargeting audience that you can push offers to very often.
