## Finding Influencers
* **Message:** Hey, do you do paid promotions? I am not looking for link clicks just followers and awareness. Please let me know so we can arrange a promotion together!

## Use [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/) to Check Influencer Stats
* If you see a 40,000+ follower day...
* The influencer has 50,000 followers total...
* And everyday they get 5-6...
* YOU KNOW ITS FAKE.
* However, if the growth is stable on their account that is VERY good and shows they are real profiles.
* The other way to tell if they are real or not is looking at the comments. If they have 1 million followers and 2 comments.. we have a problem. If they have 1 million followers and 300 - 500 comments that is not the worst but the more the better!
