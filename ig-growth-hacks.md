# Instagram Growth Hacking Tips
* Use as many **hashtags** as possible
  * [Hashtagify](http://hashtagify.me/hashtag/smm) helps you find the best hashtags along with their data
* Best times to post on Instagram are in the morning and evenings 11am - 1pm and 7pm - 9pm
* Browse sponsored post with keywords like `#ad` and `#sponsored` to find influencers in your niche
* Utilize influencers with smaller audience [10k]
* Share **video content** to skyrocket your Instagram marketing. Repost videos of other peoples content with credit
  * Use [Repost](http://repostapp.com/) to *repost* content from other users
  * **Always Always. Always. ALWAYS** credit the person you’re tagging. You didn’t take the picture or video. It’s not your content. When you credit the people you post, over time you’ll start building relationships with them. 
* Show off your customer photos in Instagram marketing. You can install [Snapppt](https://apps.shopify.com/instagram-shop-by-snapppt) on Shopify

* Find out what post your competitors like
  * Follow them with your personal page and just review their likes
  * Customer photos (what products did they buy, what was the general tone of the post)
  * Influencer posts (how many followers do they have, do they add an affiliate link in their bio, what type of influencers are they working with)
  * What type of content do they like (is it only brand related – customer/influencer posts? Do they like posts within the niche? Do they like a lot of posts? What type of comments do they like?)
