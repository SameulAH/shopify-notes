# Facebook Ads
* Set up an account on [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/)
* This site manages your facebook ads in one central place

# Most Stores Fail Because...
* The targeting isn't on point and people are spending money trying to target people who DO NOT want your products
* The product isn't APPEALING via the ad to your customer so they aren't going to purchase
* You are targeting X with Y product. You need to target X lovers with X product and have your daily budget set correctly
* Speaking of daily budget... $5 ads are GREAT however, $20/day for 5 days will give you better data and allow you to move MUCH faster
