# Facebook Ads
* Set up an account on [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/)
* This site manages your facebook ads in one central place

# Most Stores Fail Because...
* The targeting isn't on point and people are spending money trying to target people who DO NOT want your products
* The product isn't APPEALING via the ad to your customer so they aren't going to purchase
* You are targeting X with Y product. You need to target X lovers with X product and have your daily budget set correctly
* Speaking of daily budget... $5 ads are GREAT however, $20/day for 5 days will give you better data and allow you to move MUCH faster

# Ad
* Make a slide show video ad with text over the product pictures and some music in the background
* Can be made with software from [Animoto](https://animoto.com/)
* Videos can be 45sec - 130sec

# Campaigns
* Be sure to run Loyalty and Retargeting campaigns
* When you retarget, show them the product
* Give loyalty customers a deal

# Daily Budget
* Ideally you want to start off with $20/day for 5 days
* HOWEVER you can do $8 for 7 days and get the same data (or close to it)
* $5 daily budgets is OKAY and they have their place however you want to focus on $8 or $20 to get preliminary data to your ads
* Monitoring your ads: you want to check on them AFTER 3 days to see if they are running and the spend is going. DO NOT TOUCH THEM. DO NOT DO ANYTHING. LET THEM RUN once you launch them!
